# Munchr - A Food and Drink Recipe App

App idea - A Food and Cocktail pairing app that finds recipes using meal names.

Users can input an ingredient in either the food or drink search bar. Munchr will then populate a list of recipes that includes ingredients, instructions and an image of the meal or drink. Recent meal choices are saved in local storage and populate on the page so a user can revisit recipes.
