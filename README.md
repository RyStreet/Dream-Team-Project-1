# Dream-Team-Project-1

App idea - A Food and Cocktail pairing app that finds recipes using the ingredients you have at home.

Users can input an ingredient in either the food or drink search bar. Munchr will then populate a list of recipes that includes ingredients, instructions and an image of the meal or drink. Recent meal choices are saved in local storage and populate on the page so a user can revisit recipes.
